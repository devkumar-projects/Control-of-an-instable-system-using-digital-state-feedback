# Control-of-an-instable-system-using-digital-state-feedback
This project involved stabilizing an unstable system representing the elevation movement of a motorized arm using a digital state feedback controller with integral action.

## 📌 Overview

- Discretization of a continuous-time second-order system
- State augmentation and pole placement
- Closed-loop system simulation
- Comparison of system responses for different time constants

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Continuous to discrete system conversion
- Eigenvalue placement using Ackermann's formula
- Step response analysis of state feedback systems

## 📁 Files Included

- `state_feedback.m`: Main MATLAB script implementing the full control logic  
- `state_feedback_report.pdf`: Project report detailing the modeling, method, and results
